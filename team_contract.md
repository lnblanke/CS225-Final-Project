# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 

    We have decided to meet at least once a week and each meeting will last at least three hours because in each meeting we need to go over all the progress made in the previous week and come up with a weekly development log that reflects our progress. We will meet in person for every meeting and use Zoom to collaborate and Microsoft Words to take notes. We will assign one group member per time to take the notes of meeting, record the length of the meeting, and write the weekly development log. 
    
2. **Assistance** 

    All of our group members live together in an apartment and we all have contacts with each other. We also created a WeChat group so that we can read and answer the question of other members in time. Every group member should be expected to answer questions as soon as they saw the message. 

3. **Respect** 

    We make sure that each group member can freely speak of their ideas and ask questions during each meeting. Group members should be respectful to others when they are sharing and should never interrupt them. Whenever we meet a divergence, members should discuss their ideas in sequence and no shouting and fighting are allowed.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution**

    Theortically, every group member should be assigned with average workload. However, to prove that our group are working with maximum efficiency, we will assign each people with the part of the project based on their advantages and willingness. If our group member encounters unforeseen work (like getting covid), we will organize a special meeting to reassign the workload for each member. Nevertheless, we will never expect this to happen. In general, our goal is that every team member is assigned to have an amount of work to accomplish on each week. 

5. **Time Commitment** 

    As we are approaching the end of the semester, it is inevitable that every team member will have a situation that the final project is in conflict with coursework and exams of other classes. Our team members will spare a certain amount of time into the project each week so that each one will contribute to the group. If they have trobule finishing their assignment, other group member will help them accomplish their remaining work in that week. 

6. **Conflict Resolution** 

    Disagreement is very important for a team to spark new flash of ideas. However, we cannot allow team members to solve conflict by violence. Whenever team members have disagreement, we will try our best to come up with a compromise between two sides. Nonetheless, we will try to avoid any potential conflicts. We will use our weekly meeting and development log to reflect the problems over the past week so that we can avoid potential risks, like some team member unable to accomlish tasks or haibtually late, etc. If we meet unsolvable problems, we will inform TA in time to discuss how we should solve this problem.
